As a User
	Version 1
		I want to have a standard 52 card deck to play with
			// this will be created using js classes
			// create a 'deck' class whose constructor takes 1 parameter: cards
			// create a separate class for 'card' which takes 2 parameters: suit and value
			// create an array of the 4 different suits and store it in const suits
			// create an array of the 13 different card values and store it in const values
			// write a function that will implement .flatmap() and .map() to assign all the values a suit and return 1 array of 52 cards
			// call the function
		I want the deck to shuffle before each round
			// implement the durstenfeld shuffle algorithm on the created deck
			// store this in a class method
		I want to see the dealer's cards (1 up, 1 down)
			// dealer's cards will be stored in an array
		I want to see my cards (2 up)
		I want buttons for my options (hit, stand, submit wager)
		I want to know when I bust
		I want to have the ability to submit a wager
